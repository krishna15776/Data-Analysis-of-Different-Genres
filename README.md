Hello This is Krishna

In this Project we worked on Dataset containing data about various games to find the correlation between  
different genres and their critic score.

We used Rstudio for Data Analysis and Data Visualization for the dataset to find the correlation between Genre(Independent Variable)
 and their critic score(Dependent Variable) based on the Research Question.

Data Visualization:

1. For the Dataset obtained from the Kaggle. We modified the dataset by removing the null values from the rows.

2. We used the boxplot to plot the independent and dependent variable.

3. We plotted Histogram for the Dependent Variable and also the normalization.

Data Analysis:

1. We used Independent T-test to prove that there is a strong correlation between the Variables by showing the 
   p-value(<0.005) and also mean values of dependent variables.
